                    I've seen things you people wouldn't believe. Attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion.
                    I watched C-beams glitter in the dark near the Tannhauser gate.
                    All those moments will be lost in time... like tears in rain... <em>Time to die.</em>

                    I don't know why he saved my life. Maybe in those last moments he loved life more than he ever had before.
                    Not just his life - anybody's life; my life. All he'd wanted were the same answers...
